        <h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
        <h2>Act 3, Scene 1</h2>
        <p><strong>SCENE I.</strong> A room in Lucullus' house.</p>
        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong> waiting. <strong>Enter a Servant to him</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Servant</strong><br>I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.</p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>I thank you, sir.</p>

        <p><strong>Enter LUCULLUS</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Servant</strong><br>Here's my lord.</p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>[Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? A gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.<br><strong>Exit Servants</strong></p>

        <p>And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?</p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>His health is well sir.</p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?</p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.</p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas, good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha' dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get him from't.</p>

        <p><strong>Re-enter Servant, with wine</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Servant</strong><br>Please your lordship, here is the wine.</p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.</p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>Your lordship speaks your pleasure.</p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well: good parts in thee.<br>To <strong>Servant</strong><br>Get you gone, sirrah.<br><strong>Exit Servant</strong></p>

        <p>Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou knowest well enough, although thou comest to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship, without security. Here's three solidaires for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.</p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>Is't possible the world should so much differ, And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness, To him that worships thee!<br><strong>Throwing the money back</strong></p>

        <p><strong>LUCULLUS</strong><br>Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.<br><strong>Exit</strong></p>

        <p><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong><br>May these add to the number that may scald thee! Let moulten coin be thy damnation, Thou disease of a friend, and not himself! Has friendship such a faint and milky heart, It turns in less than two nights? O you gods, I feel master's passion! this slave, Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him: Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment, When he is turn'd to poison? O, may diseases only work upon't! And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for, be of any power To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!<br><strong>Exit</strong></p>

    <!-- Addendum -->
    <article>
        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p>This addendum explains the structural and stylistic choices made in the HTML and CSS encoding of the text from "Timon of Athens," Act 3, Scene 1.</p>
        
        <h2>Structural Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong> Tags: Used for the play title and scene title, respectively, to create a clear hierarchy and sectioning of content.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> Tags: Employed for paragraphs and stage directions to separate blocks of text and improve readability.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> Tags: Applied to emphasize character names and important actions (e.g., "Exit," "Enter"), clarifying the dramatic structure.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;br&gt;</strong> Tags: Used within dialogue to preserve line breaks and the play's original structure.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>CSS Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choice:</strong> The Georgia font is used for its classic look and readability in long texts.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> The play title uses a 2.5em size for prominence, while the scene title is set to 2em.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> Dark blue headings (`#00509E`) and dark grey text (`#333`) provide an elegant contrast on a light grey background (`#f9f9f9`).</li>
            <li><strong>Margins and Padding:</strong> The body has 20px padding, and articles are given margins for a clean layout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
        <p>No misuse of HTML tags occurred. The `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags were used appropriately, and `<br>` tags were used only to preserve the formatting of the play's dialogue.</p>
